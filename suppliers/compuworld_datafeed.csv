		Dual Quad HD (5120 x 1440)


	32:9 SuperWide screen designed to replace multiscreen setups&nbsp;32:9 SuperWide 49&quot; screen, with 5120 x 1440 resolution, is designed to replace multiscreen setups for massive wide view. It&#39;s like having two 27&quot; 16:9 Quad HD displays side-by-side. SuperWide monitors offer screen area of dual monitors without the complicated setup.&nbsp;

	Effortlessly smooth action with Adaptive-Sync technology&nbsp;Gaming shouldn&#39;t be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate with Adaptive-Sync technology, smooth quick refresh and ultra-fast response time.&nbsp;

	Built in USB-C docking station&nbsp;This Philips display features a built-in USB 3.1 type-C docking station with power delivery. Its slim, reversible USB-C connector allows for easy, one-cable docking. Simplify by connecting all your peripherals like keyboard, mouse and your RJ-45 Ethernet cable to the monitor&#39;s docking station. Simply connect your notebook and this monitor with a single USB-C cable to watch high-resolution video and transfer super-speed data, while powering up and re-charging your notebook at the same time.&nbsp;

	Built-in KVM switch to easily switch between sources&nbsp;With MultiClient Integrated KVM switch, you can control two separate PCs with one monitor-keyboard-mouse set up. A convenient button allows you to quickly switch between sources. Handy with set-ups that require dual PC computing power or sharing one large monitor to show two different PCs.&nbsp;

	Securely sign in with pop-up webcam with Windows Hello&trade;Phillips&#39; innovative and secure webcam pops up when you need it and securely tucks back into the monitor when you are not using it. The webcam is also equipped with advanced sensors for Windows Hello&trade; facial recognition, which conveniently logs you into your Windows devices in less than 2 seconds, 3 times faster than a password.&nbsp;

	DisplayHDR 400 for more lifelike colorful visuals&nbsp;VESA-certified DisplayHDR 400 delivers a significant step-up from normal SDR displays. Unlike, other &#39;HDR compatible&#39; screens, true DisplayHDR 400 produces astonishing brightness, contrast and colors. With global dimming and peak brightness up-to 400 nits, images come to life with notable highlights while featuring deeper, more nuanced blacks. It renders a fuller palette of rich new colors, delivering a visual experience that engages your senses.&nbsp;

	LowBlue Mode for easy on-the-eyes productivity&nbsp;Studies have shown that just as ultra-violet rays can cause eye damage, shortwave length blue light rays from LED displays can cause eye damage and affect vision over time. Developed for wellbeing, Philips LowBlue Mode setting uses a smart software technology to reduce harmful shortwave blue light.&nbsp;

	Less eye fatigue with Flicker-free technology&nbsp;Due to the way brightness is controlled on LED-backlit screens, some users experience flicker on their screen which causes eye fatigue. Philips Flicker-free Technology applies a new solution to regulate brightness and reduce flicker for more comfortable viewing.&nbsp;

	MultiView enables simultaneous dual connect and view&nbsp;With the ultra-high resolution Philips MultiView display you can now experience a world of connectivity. MultiView enables active dual connect and view so that you can work with multiple devices like a PC and notebook simultaneously, for complex multi-tasking.

	The High Performance &quot;Zen 3&quot; Architecture

	Debuting in AMD Ryzen&trade; 5000 Series desktop processors, the &quot;Zen 3&quot; architecture is a ground-up redesign of the legendary &quot;Zen&rdquo; family. Equipped with end-to-end design enhancements, &quot;Zen 3&quot; embodies AMD&rsquo;s relentless focus on single-core performance, energy efficiency, and reduced latencies. It&rsquo;s at the core of the best gaming processors in the world1.

	&nbsp;

	Features

	Total Redesign

	The &quot;Zen 3&quot; architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the &quot;Zen&quot; era. Over 20 major changes include: wider and more flexible execution resources; significantly more load/store bandwidth to feed execution; and a streamlined front-end to get more threads in flight&mdash;and do it faster.

	&nbsp;

	Higher Instructions Per Clock (IPC)

	The &quot;Zen 3&quot; architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation2. This a historically large generational improvement in IPC, and a major player in the architecture&rsquo;s ability to deliver unmatched single-core performance1.

	&nbsp;

	Lower Latency

	The &quot;Zen 3&quot; architecture transitions to a new &quot;unified complex&quot; design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus &quot;Zen 2.&quot;

	&nbsp;

	King of the Hill

	The combination of higher IPC and the unified 8-core complex are a potent combination for PC games. Customers upgrading from the AMD Ryzen&trade; 3000 Series to the 5000 Series can expect an average of 26% better gaming performance at 1080p3. But that&rsquo;s not all: processors with &quot;Zen 3,&quot; like the AMD Ryzen&trade; 9 5900X, are the best in the world for PC gaming4.

	&nbsp;

	Incredible Efficiency

	Impressively, the performance gains of the &quot;Zen 3&quot; architecture can be delivered with no increase to power consumption or TDP. The combination of a state-of-the-art architecture and industry-leading 7nm process give the AMD Ryzen&trade; 5000 Series a +24% generational improvement in energy efficiency5, and a stunning 2.8X lead over competing architectures6.

			GEMINI S
		
			RGB Mid-Tower
		
			Gemini S is an advanced gaming mid-tower case with a full-sized tempered glass cover and an integrated RGB lighting system that delivers everything a gamer needs.&nbsp;
		
			&nbsp;
		
			Integrated RGB Lighting
	


	
		
			
				Gemini S features COUGAR&rsquo;s exclusive Trelux integrated lighting system. This advanced design allows it to display fourteen amazing lighting effects without installing any additional devices in the case and control them through the integrated lighting button.
			
				Trelux can also work connected to a COUGAR Core Box v2 or to a compatible motherboards&rsquo; 5V connection for system-wide lighting synchronization.
			
				&nbsp;
			
				
					
						Elegant Design
				
			
			
				&nbsp;
			
				
					
						Gemini S&rsquo; brushed metal-like front panel gives it a unique look that sets it apart from other compact cases. This texture is also a great companion to the integrated lighting since the powerful lights coming out of it benefit from the reflective surroundings that help reinforce the effects.
					
						&nbsp;
					
						Full Side Visibility
					
						&nbsp;
					
						To help you appreciate your system&rsquo;s full beauty, a full-sized tempered glass side window will allow you to contemplate your system&rsquo;s interior.
					
						&nbsp;
					
						Great Support for Components
					
						&nbsp;
					
						You won&rsquo;t believe how powerful a gaming beast you can build inside Gemini S. Its advanced support for graphics cards (up to three 410mm-long graphics cards) will allow you to enjoy the latest games with smooth framerates.

	PURITAS

	Tempered Glass Cover Mid-Tower Case with Enhanced Cooling

	&nbsp;

	PURITAS is a case for the valiant. For those who want a build that is truly theirs. For the creators. For the modding heroes. For the serious PC builders. It is a case for those who want to put their skills to the test. Fully transparent and with plenty of space for high-end components, PURITAS&#39; limits are only your own.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Pure Tempered Glass

	&nbsp;

	Four tempered glass covers create a black mirrored box that allows internal lighting to go out in a semi-transparent manner. This can both be used as-is, which will result in a beautiful case with a reflective effect, or in combination with internal lighting to create unique effects that will amaze you and your friends.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Powerful Cooling

	&nbsp;

	To run the latest games, you need potent components that generate lots of heat; PURITAS allows you to enjoy gaming without worrying about overheating thanks to its fantastic cooling support. With the possibility of installing up to five water cooling radiators and ten fans, you will have greater leeway in designing the right solution to keep your computer well cooled!

	&nbsp;

	PURITAS also includes a fan control system that can be used to optimize the speed of non-PWM fans (those with three pin-connectors). The included VORTEX LED fans can be controlled through this system too, allowing you to optimize the cooling performance.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	
		Water cooling radiator support
	
		Up to 5 radiators


	

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	
		Air cooling support
	
		Up to 10 fans


	

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Superior Gaming Specs

	&nbsp;

	We built PURITAS not only to be a beautiful case but also to be able to house a truly powerful computer. This shows in its excellent support for high-end gaming components. With seven expansion slots, PURITAS allows you to install up to three 425mm long graphics cards. It also has dedicated space for storage: two 3.5&quot; bays and four 2.5&quot; bays give you space for all the SDDs and HDDs you need.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Three Amazing Light Rings

	&nbsp;

	PURITAS comes with 3 COUGAR VORTEX LED fans that, apart from including the latest technology in fan design, sport a unique tri-directional (inward-forward-outward) light circle, visible from a 180 degree angle. With 33 LEDs per fan, these fans are also brighter than the average backlit fan.

	&nbsp;

	Why fitting two types of sensor onto one mouse? &nbsp;The HDST&trade; Difference.

	The conventional gaming mouse is fitted with either a laser senor or an optical sensor and the two different sensor types are preferred by different groups of gamer who play different types of game such as first-person-shooting a.k.a. FPS or real-time-strategy a.k.a. RTS.

	Such specific preference on sensor type when it comes to different types of game are for good reasons. These are the pros and cons of the two different sensor types.

	WD Blue 1TB

	WD Blue drives are designed and manufactured with the proven technology found in WD&#39;s original award-winning desktop and mobile hard drives.

	&nbsp;

	Features:

	Trusted engineering

	Built to WD&rsquo;s highest standards of quality and reliability, WD Blue offers the features and entry-level capacities that are ideal for your computing needs. WD Blue is designed by the brand that you trust with the quality you would expect for a tested, proven, everyday storage solution.

	&nbsp;

	A modern classic

	WD Blue storage is designed and manufactured with technology found in WD&rsquo;s original award-winning desktop and mobile hard drives. WD Blue sets the baseline for everyday storage by consistently delivering improved performance over previous generations while successfully maintaining WD&rsquo;s quality and reliability for over six generations. The difference is that our colors never fade, generation after generation.

	&nbsp;

	Your power of choice

	WD Blue is available in a broad range of entry-level capacities, cache sizes, form factors and interfaces so you can be sure there&rsquo;s a drive that&rsquo;s the perfect fit for your system. However, not all hard drives are created equally and for your applications that demand more, WD gives you the power of choice.

	&nbsp;

	Drive with confidence

	We perform tests on hundreds of systems, configurations, and a multitude of platforms in our FIT Lab&trade; to give our customers the confidence that our drives will work in their systems for the ultimate compatibility. WD Blue allows you to use our drive with confidence, knowing that our storage advancements such as NoTouch&trade; Ramp Load technology are proven and reliable everyday solutions.

	&nbsp;

	The WD advantage

	WD puts our products through extensive Functional Integrity Testing (F.I.T.) prior to any product launch. This testing ensures our products consistently meet the highest quality and reliability standards of the WD brand. WD also has a detailed Knowledge Base with more than 1,000 helpful articles as well as helpful software and utilities. Our customer support lines have longer operational hours to ensure you get the help you need when you need it. Our toll-free customer support lines are here to help or you can access our WD Support site for additional details.

	&nbsp;

	Easy upgrade

	Acronis True Image, available as a download on the WD Support website, enables you to copy all your data to a new drive so you don&#39;t have to reinstall your operating system to get all the benefits of a new drive.

	&nbsp;

	Recommended use

	WD Blue storage is tested and recommended for use in desktop and All-in-One PCs, industrial applications, notebooks, and external enclosures where capacity is not needed. For additional capacity, look at WD Green capacity storage drives.

	&nbsp;

	SATA or PATA, the choice is yours

	While SATA has become the industry standard interface, WD continues to manufacture desktop drives with a PATA interface for unique or legacy systems.

	WD Purple Surveillance Storage offers exclusive AllFrame technology to bring you premium reliability and peace-of-mind when installing your home or small to medium business security system. WD Purple&#39;s exclusive firmware upgrades work with ATA streaming to reduce error pixilation and video interruptions that occur when desktop hard drives are incorrectly used as storage in security systems. WD Purple Surveillance Storage is built for 24/7, always-on, high-definition surveillance security systems that use up to eight hard drives and up to 32 cameras.

	&nbsp;

	WD Purple surveillance-class storage has been tested to be compatible in a wide-range of security systems. These drives are designed to replace standard desktop drives that were not designed for the harsh 24/7 always-on, high-definition surveillance environment. Desktop drives are built to run for only short intervals and are not engineered to withstand high-temperature fluctuations and equipment vibrations found in a typical surveillance application.

Exclusive AllFrame&trade; technology helps reduce frame loss and improve overall video playback.

	&nbsp;

	Logitech MK220 Wireless desktop keyboard &amp; mouse

	The compact keyboard-and-mouse combo with all the right keys.
	
	Super space saver
	This clever little keyboard has all the standard keys&mdash;so you can save lots of space without missing a thing.

	
	Free to roam
	The reliable wireless connection lets you work or play up to 10 meters (33 feet) away with virtually no delays or dropouts.*

	
	Good life
	You can go for months without battery hassles&mdash;24 months for the keyboard and 5 months for the mouse.**

	* Wireless range may vary due to environmental and computing conditions.
	** Keyboard battery life calculation based on an estimated two million keystrokes/year in an office environment. User experience may vary. Mouse battery life may vary based on user and computing conditions.

	&nbsp;

	
	Much smaller design, same keys
	The compact keyboard is about 36% smaller than standard keyboards but still has all the standard keys&mdash;so doing the things you love is as easy as ever.

	

	
	Advanced 2.4 GHz wireless
	So you can work or play in more places&mdash;like your comfy couch&mdash;the wireless connection virtually eliminates delays, dropouts and interference and gives you a range of up to 10 meters (33 feet).*

	

	
	128-bit AES encryption
	It helps protect your information by encrypting data transfer between the keyboard and receiver with one of the highest levels of data encryption available.

	

	
	Fewer battery hassles
	A 24-month keyboard and 5-month mouse battery life mean you can go for months without the hassle of changing batteries.**

	

	
	Sleek, minimalist design
	The keyboard&rsquo;s minimalist design not only blends in with your d&eacute;cor&mdash;it serves a purpose. No extra space between the keys makes it compact as well as sleek.

	

	
	Plug-and-play simplicity
	Setup couldn&rsquo;t be easier&mdash;you simply plug the wireless receiver into a USB port on your computer and start tweeting, blogging and IMing right away without software.

	

	
	Whisper-quiet keys
	The keys barely make a sound, so you can hear the song you&rsquo;re listening to&mdash;instead of the sound of typing.

	Overview

	&nbsp;

	Lenovo offers a comprehensive portfolio of value-added services that support the full lifecycle of your Lenovo assets from procurement to disposition. Our service experience can optimise productivity and user satisfaction by reducing downtime, and enabling you or your IT staff to focus on your business-critical issues.

	All Lenovo warranties include phone access to customer support and full coverage on labour, parts and system repair for all manufacturer defects or common-use issues that arise with your Lenovo Product. If an issue cannot be resolved by phone, Lenovo will dispatch a certified technician to attempt repair of your machine at your location with no shipping involved. This service provides parts and labour repair coverage where labour is provided onsite at your place of business. If Lenovo determines your product problem is covered by the product warranty and cannot be resolved over the telephone or with a customer replaceable unit, repair will be made onsite, typically the next business day. Service is available during Lenovo&rsquo;s normal in-country business hours. Calls received after 4pm local time will require an additional business day for service dispatch. On-site service is available in metropolitan areas only. Next business day service is not guaranteed.

				3 Year Lenovo&trade; Onsite Support (Add-On)
			
				&nbsp;
			This is an add on service, and not the actual warranty.
			
				This add on service must match the length of warranty. If the warranty term is shorter than the length of this add on service you will need to purchase a warranty extension with this add on service.
		
	


	
		
			
				HOW DOES IT WORK?
			Warranty upgrade to Onsite Service is an affordable solution that maximizes PC uptime and productivity by providing convenient, fast repair service at your place.&nbsp;
			
				&nbsp;
			
				Lenovo&rsquo;s Warranty Services are provided by Lenovo-trained technicians, using Lenovo Qualified parts, giving you the high standards of quality and customer care you&#39;ve come to expect from Lenovo. You get the peace of mind to know your assets are protected, and your IT staff the freedom to focus on critical business objectives.
		
	


	
		&nbsp;
	
		
			
	


	
		
			
				ONSITE SERVICE LEVEL
			Lenovo will perform an initial problem determination remotely. Our repair service representative will work with you during the problem determination to identify whether the problem resides with your Lenovo machine, other machines or various software loaded on the machine. Lenovo will either repair or exchange the failing machine at your location and verify functionality. &nbsp;&nbsp;
			
				&nbsp;
			
				If the result of this determination exercise is that the checked Lenovo machine is failing and non-functional, then a service technician will visit your location, unless the problem can be solved via a CRU or software/BIOS/microcode update. &nbsp;&nbsp;
				
					&nbsp;
				
					The date and time for onsite intervention will be mutually agreed upon. Lenovo will either repair or exchange the failing machine at your location and verify functionality. You must provide a suitable working area, clean and well lit, to allow disassembly and reassembling of the Lenovo machine.
			
		
	


	
		
			
	


	
		
			
				CUSTOMER BENEFITS
			
				
					Minimizing unplanned maintenance expenses reduces operating expenses because out of warranty repairs typically cost $150 - $399 &nbsp;&nbsp;
				
					At the time of PC purchase, equipment expenses can be accurately budgeted for to ensure that systems are covered against unplanned service expenses &nbsp;&nbsp;
				
					Shortening downtime and maximizing productivity and hardware availability as a result of the award winning high-quality technical support that Lenovo provides &nbsp;&nbsp;
				
					Fast access to technical help with significantly higher first time fix rates (30% higher than competition), lower hold times and abandon rates (60% lower than competition) &nbsp;&nbsp;
				
					Onsite warranty decreases the downtime because with Depot coverage the PC is shipped / dropped off to an Approved Service Provider or Lenovo repair center. The customer will then be without their system for a minimum of 5 days&nbsp; &nbsp;
				
					Saving IT resources (time and money) by having Lenovo support available to address the customer`s issues quickly
			
		
	


	
		
			
				WARRANTY SERVICES
			Lenovo offers a range of warranty options for Think branded products, dependent on the machine type and base warranty. Warranty Extensions are available for periods of up to five years (depending on system) providing a fixed-term, fixed-cost service solution that allows accurate budgeting for equipment expenses. Warranty Upgrades enable customers to vary response time and level of service to match critical support needs.

	- CORSAIR AXON Hyper-Processing Technology enables a new level of K70 performance, processing and transmitting your inputs up to 8x faster than conventional gaming keyboards with 8,000Hz hyper-polling, 4,000Hz key scanning, and up to 20 layers of hardware RGB lighting processing while maintaining speed performance.

	100% CHERRY MX SPEED RGB Silver mechanical keyswitches offer lightning-fast response times with an actuation distance of just 1.2mm, and are guaranteed for 100 million keystrokes.

	- Precision-molded PBT double-shot keycaps with a standard bottom row layout resist wear, fading, and shine, with 1.5mm thickness for rigid stability.

	- Flip the tournament switch and focus on winning that crucial game, automatically locking to distraction-free static backlighting and disabling accidental macro activations.

	- A detachable braided USB Type-C cable makes the K70 RGB PRO easy to set up and ready to take on the go.

	- A magnetic, soft-touch palm rest seamlessly snaps onto the keyboard, with a soft-touch patterned surface for grip and comfort during the longest gaming sessions.

	- Dedicated media and function keys control your media, while the signature CORSAIR aluminum roller smoothly adjusts volume levels and is fully programmable in iCUE software to perform custom actions.

	- Record macros on-the-fly with a convenient hotkey and save them to FN key combination shortcuts, for easy access to complex actions without sacrificing standard key functionality.

	- Store up to 50 onboard profiles with custom macros, actions, and your own unique vibrant RGB lighting effects, driven by AXON with up to 20 lighting layers.

	- Powerful CORSAIR iCUE software on both Windows and macOS enables dynamic RGB lighting control, key remaps and macro programming, and exclusive iCUE integrations with select games that turn your entire system&rsquo;s lighting into an extension of the action.

	- Full N-key rollover (NKRO) and 100% anti-ghosting ensures that every keypress registers, no matter how fast you play.

					A high-quality, high-performance headset that brings your PC calls and music to life.
				
					&nbsp;
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							As simple as plug-and-play
						
							With the plug-and-play USB connection, you&rsquo;ll experience crisp, digital stereo and more true-to-life calls almost instantaneously.
					
				
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							Listen to the details
						
							Laser-tuned drivers and a built-in equalizer minimize distortion, so you can get to the heart of all your music, movies and calling. It&rsquo;s the kind of precision audio that exemplifies the difference between merely hearing and truly wanting to listen.
					
				
			
			
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							Experience crystal-clear chatting
						
							Breathe new life into your chatting. The adjustable microphone reduces background noises, so your friends, family and business associates can hear more of what they want&mdash;your crystal clear voice.
					
				
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							Take control of the sound
						
							Use the on-ear controls for simple volume adjusting and instant mic muting. Plus, you&rsquo;ll never talk with the mute on again, thanks to the easy-to-see mute indicator light.
					
				
			
			
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							It&rsquo;s all about comfort
						
							Soft leatherette padding is easy on your ears&mdash;especially when you&rsquo;re listening to music or chatting for hours. Worried about the fit? Don&rsquo;t be. The padding on the headband ensures a fit that molds comfortably to the contours of your head.
					
				
				
					
						
							
					
					
						
							Plays nice
						
							Works with common calling applications including Skype&trade;, Google Hangouts&trade;, Yahoo!&reg;Messenger, and other calling services.

	Instructions

	
		Remove the protective membrane and clean the surface on which you plan to use COUGAR Bunker S RGB.
	
		Place COUGAR Bunker S RGB on the desired surface, with the suction pad facing downwards, and press the mouse bungee&rsquo;s base gently against it, then push the lever downwards.
	
		Place the headset on the headset mount.
	
		Removal: Pull the suction lever upwards. Then, grip the silicone protuberance located in the back of the bungee&rsquo;s suction pad and pull it upwards to remove it from the surface.


	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Caution

	The range of suitable uneven surfaces (flat surfaces) does not include cloth, wool, cotton or similar materials, nor does it include any porous surface.

	&nbsp;

	Maintenance&nbsp;

	The suction pad has a degree of stickiness. If, after prolonged use, you notice a decrease in the steadiness of the device and a weakening of its suction, please use a wet tissue or a damp cloth to wipe it, being careful to avoid liquid contact with any part other than the suction pad. After removing any dirt or impurity with it, please wait until the suction pad is completely dry; it will regain its stickiness.

	BUNKER S RGB

	The Best RGB Headset Stand Ever

	&nbsp;

	Don&rsquo;t know where to put your gaming headset when you&rsquo;re not using it? Need an extra pair of USB ports? Interested in adding an RGB touch to your build? Bunker S RGB is what you need.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Suction Like You&rsquo;ve Never Seen Before

	&nbsp;

	Bunker S RGB&rsquo;s suction pad makes use of patented technology to attach itself with incredible strength to the surface you want to use it on. This technology protects your headset: the stand won&rsquo;t fall if it is accidentally hit, even by relatively strong forces.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Two Modes to Suit Everybody

	&nbsp;

	Bunker S RGB can be used in two different modes: Standard Mode, in which it is attached to a horizontal surface, and Case Mode, in which it attaches itself to a vertical surface such as your PC case. This gives you leeway to decide how to manage your space, helping you to optimize your desktop layout.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	RGB Lighting

	&nbsp;

	Bunker S RGB can display fourteen fantastic lighting effects that can be selected merely by pressing a button.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Convenient USB Hub

	&nbsp;

	Ideal for charging or synchronizing electronic devices, connecting extra peripherals or storing data on portable USB drives, Bunker S RGB&rsquo;s on board two-port USB hub is extremely convenient.

	TP-LINK TL-SF1008P&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Highlights:

	
		With four PoE ports, transfers data and power on one single cable
	
		Working with IEEE 802.3af compliant PDs, expands home and office network
	
		Requires no configuration and installation


	&nbsp;

	What This Product Does

	TL-SF1008P is an 8 10/100Mbps ports unmanaged switch that requires no configuration and provides 4 PoE (Power over Ethernet) ports. It can automatically detect and supply power with all IEEE 802.3af compliant Powered Devices (PDs). In this situation, the electrical power is transmitted along with data in one single cable allowing you to expand your network to where there are no power lines or outlets, where you wish to &shy;fix devices such as APs, IP Cameras or IP Phones, etc.

	Power over Ethernet

	4 of the 8 Auto-Negotiation RJ45 ports (port-1 to port-4) of the switch support Power over Ethernet (PoE) function. These PoE ports can automatically detect and supply power with those IEEE 802.3af compliant Powered Devices (PDs).&nbsp;

	-Overload Arrangement

	TL-SF1008P has the priority function which will help protect the system when the system power is overloaded. If all PoE PDs power consumption is &gt;= 57W, a priority will be arranged among the PoE ports, then the system will cut oâ€‘ the power of the lowest-priority port.

	&nbsp;

	-Port Priority Function

	Priority (port-1=port-2=port-3&gt;port-4): &nbsp;This function will help to ensure the normal operation of the system, it means Port 4 will be cut off when all total PoE PDs power consumption exceed 57W. For an example, Port 1, 2 and 4 is using 15.4W (maximum power for per port is 15.4W); the system power is 46.2W in total. If there is an additional PD inserted to Port 3 with 12W, and then the system will cut off the power of Port 4 because of the overloaded power, this means Port 1, 2 will use 15.4W, and Port3 will use 12W, no power will be supplied to Port 4.

	Easy To Use

	TL-SF1008P is easy to install and use. It requires no confi&shy;guration and installation. With desktop design, outstanding performance and quality, the TP-LINK&rsquo;s TL-SF1008P 8-Port 10/100Mbps Desktop Switch with 4-Port PoE is an ideal choice for expanding your home or office network.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	
		What This Product Does
	
		&nbsp;
	
		TL-SG1005P is a 5 10/100/1000Mbps ports unmanaged switch that requires no configuration and provides 4 PoE (Power over Ethernet) ports. It can automatically detect and supply power with all IEEE 802.3af compliant Powered Devices (PDs). In this situation, the electrical power is transmitted along with data in one single cable allowing you to expand your network to where there are no power lines or outlets, where you wish to fix devices such as APs, IP Cameras or IP Phones, etc.&nbsp;
	
		&nbsp;
	
		&nbsp;
	
		
			Power over Ethernet
		
			&nbsp;
		
			4 of the 5 Auto-Negotiation RJ45 ports (Port 1 to Port 4) of the switch support Power over Ethernet (PoE) function. These PoE ports can automatically detect and supply power with those IEEE 802.3af compliant Powered Devices (PDs).
		
			&nbsp;
		
			Overload Arrangement
		
			&nbsp;
		
			TL-SG1005P has the priority function which will help protect the system when the system power is overloaded. If all PoE PDs power consumption is &gt;= 56W, a priority will be arranged among the PoE ports, then the system will cut off the power of the lowest-priority port.
		
			&nbsp;
		
			Port Priority Function
		
			&nbsp;
		
			Priority (Port 1=Port 2=Port 3&gt;Port 4): This function will help to ensure the normal operation of the system, it means Port 4 will be cut off when all total PoE PDs power consumption exceed 56W. For an example, Port 1, 2 and 4 is using 15.4W (maximum power for per port is 15.4W); the system power is 46.2W in total. If there is an additional PD inserted to Port 3 with 10W, and then the system will cut off the power of Port 4 because of the overloaded power, this means Port 1, 2 will use 15.4W, and Port3 will use 10W, no power will be supplied to Port 4. &nbsp;
		
			&nbsp;
		
			&nbsp;
		
			
				Easy To Use
			
				&nbsp;
			
				TL-SG1005P is easy to install and use. It requires no configuration and installation. With desktop design, outstanding performance and quality, the TP-Link&rsquo;s TL-SG1005P 5-Port Gigabit Desktop Switch with 4-Port PoE is an ideal choice for expanding your home or office network. &nbsp;

	TL-SG1016PE

	16 10/100/1000Mbps RJ45 ports

	Equipped with 8 PoE+ supported ports to transfer data and power over a single cable

	With a total PoE power budget of 110W, up to 30W per port

	Works with IEEE 802.3af/at compliant devices, expanding home and office networks

	Simple network set-up on top of plug-and-play connectivity&nbsp;

	Web-based user interface and management utility simplify configuration&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	What This Product Does

	The TL-SG1016PE is an 16-Port Gigabit Desktop/Rack mountable Switch with 8 ports supporting the PoE+ standard. It provides a simple way to expand a wired network by transferring power and data over a single Ethernet Cable. With a total power budget of 110W, up to 30W per port, TL-SG1016PE can power more high-powered devices such as wireless Access Points (APs), IP Cameras or IP Phones. Moreover, with innovative energy-efficient technology, the TL-SG1016PE can save up to 75% of the power consumption, making it an eco-friendly solution for your business network.

	&nbsp;

	How This Product Works

	8 ports of TL-SG1016PE support Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE+) standard which can automatically detect and supply power to any IEEE 802.3af/at compliant device(s). In this situation, the electrical power is transmitted along with data in a single cable, allowing you to expand your network where there are electrical cables or outlets, where you wish to fix devices such as APs, IP Cameras or IP Phones.

	&nbsp;

	Overload Arrangement

	TL-SG1016PE has a priority function which helps protect the system when its power is overloaded. If all PoE+ devices&rsquo; power consumption is greater than or equal to 110W, a priority will be arranged among the 16 PoE+ ports, at which point the system will cut off the power of the lowest-priority port.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Port Priority Function

	*Priority (port 1&gt;port 2&gt;port 3&gt;port 4&gt; port 5&gt;port 6&gt;port 7&gt;port 8): This function will help protect the system if the system power becomes overloaded. For example, Port 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are using 30w (maximum power per port is 30W), the system power is 110w in total (PoE max LED will be green if all PoE PDs power consumption is &gt;= 110W). If there is an additional PD inserted to Port 4 with 20w then the system will cut off Port 5 to protect the system, this means Port 1, 2 ,3, will use 90w, and Port 4 will use 20w, and no power will be supplied to Port 5.

	&nbsp;

	Easy To Use

	TL-SG1016PE is easy to install and use. It requires no configuration or installation. With its Desktop/Rack mountable design, outstanding performance and quality, the TP-LINK TL-SG1016PE 16-Port Gigabit Desktop/Rack mountable Switch with 8-Port PoE is a great choice for expanding your home or office network.

	Go Green With Your Ethernet

	You now have the choice to go green when upgrading to a gigabit network! This new generation of TL-SG1024DE 24-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch features the latest energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your network&rsquo;s capacity with much less power. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Power down Idle Ports

	When a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TL-SG1024DE can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle.

	&nbsp;

	Power Budget According to Cable Length

	Ideally, shorter cables would use less power with less power degradation over their length; this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters in length. The TL-SG1024DE analyzes the length of the Ethernet cable connected and adjusts the power usage accordingly, rather than keeping the power consumption in a conventional solution.&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Ease of Use

	TL-SG1024DE is easy to use and manage. Auto MDI/MDI-X crossover on all ports eliminates the need for crossover cables or uplink ports. Auto-negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (either 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance. Its compact size makes it ideal for desktops with limited space while also being rack-mountable, convenient and safe. Dynamic LED lights provide real-time work status display and basic fault diagnosis.&nbsp;

	FORTRESS

	The Ultimate Gaming Backpack

	&nbsp;

	Fortress is COUGAR&rsquo;s answer to the mobility needs of gamers. With the capability of storing all your gaming gear as well as a gaming laptop, everything you need for a great gaming session can fit inside it, protected within its shockproof anti-vibration structure.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Multi-layered Structure

	As important as bringing all your stuff with you is to guarantee that you will find it when you need it. Fortress&#39; multi-layered structure allows you to keep everything tidy and protected, with space for every single thing a gamer might need.

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Shockproof Anti-vibration Structure

	Gaming gear is expensive, and nothing ruins a gaming trip like an unfortunate impact that breaks your laptop. To protect you against these dangers, Fortress features a shockproof anti-vibration structure that minimizes or nullifies the damage from impacts.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Padded Back Panel + Chest Strap

	Fortress strives to protect the single most crucial piece of equipment: your body. Its padded back panel makes wearing it highly comfortable, and its chest strap reduces the pressure on your shoulders and redistributes it to protect your back.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Dual Use

	Fortress can be used both as a backpack and as a shoulder bag, to fit all gamers&#39; functional and style requirements.

		Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4
	
		SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Card
	
		Core Clock:
	
		Extreme Performance: 2497 MHz (MSI Center)
	
		Boost: 2482 MHz
	
		STORMFORCE FAN: Seven fan blades, claw texturing, and a circular arc are designed for optimal airflow with minimal noise.
	
		Nickel-plated Copper Baseplate: Heat from the GPU and memory is swiftly captured by a nickel-plated copper baseplate and transferred.
	
		Core Pipes feature a square design to maximize contact with the GPU baseplate for optimal thermal management.
	
		WAVE-CURVED 3.0: Additional efficiency is gained by adjusting the size of the wave edges under the fan motor and other spots where there is less airflow.
	
		AIR ANTEGRADE FIN: Fins with a V-shaped cutout are located at the airflow passthrough to improve flow efficiency. Optimizing the inclination angle and increasing the wave notch shapes the air resistance towards the center, pushing out warm air faster like a nozzle.
	
		Metal Backplate: A reinforcing metal backplate with airflow vents and thermal pads enhances cooling.
	
		MSI Center: The exclusive MSI Center software lets you monitor, tweak and optimize MSI products in real-time.
	
		Afterburner software takes full control with the most recognized and widely used graphics card overclocking software in the world.

	Long-lasting data protection with M-DISC&trade; Support

	The M-DISC&trade; uses a patented rock-like recording surface instead of organic dye to etch your records. The M-DISC offers superior reliability in data storage compared to other recordable DVDs on the market today.

	

	Play in peace with less noise

	As a disc is being read, Silent Play technology helps reduce the noise during playback by automatically adjusting the playback speed.

	

	&nbsp;

	Non-stop seamless playability

	Jamless Play prevents the video playback stopping due to a damaged disc. Damage such as scratches and fingerprints are ignored by jumping through the erroneous data or damaged areas.

	

	&nbsp;

	8x DVD&plusmn;R Writing Speed

	Higher writing speed reduces the time taken to copy data.

	

	&nbsp;

	TV Connectivity

	Quickly and easily connect to TVs, digital photo frames and PCs via USB for playback.

	

	&nbsp;

	Windows &amp; Mac OS Compatible

	Enjoy freedom in use, compatible for both Windows series and MAC OS.

	&nbsp;

	Easy Setup &ndash; Get the best angle and video from your Kasa Cam with an easy to adjust camera stand. Place it on a flat surface and start monitoring or use the magnetic base to affix it to your fridge.

	&nbsp;

	Instant Notifications &ndash; With motion and sound detection, the Kasa Smart app alerts you of activity that matters and sends notifications straight to your smartphone.

	&nbsp;

	Watch from Anywhere &ndash; Watch live or recorded video at any time on your smartphone with the free Kasa Smart app. Even stream live video to any Alexa or Google Assistant** supported display, like a Fire TV or Google Chromecast.

	Adata 480G SU650 2.5&quot; SSD ASU650SS-480GT-C

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	The Ultimate SU650 solid state drive implements 3D NAND Flash and a high speed controller, offering capacities up to 960GB. It delivers read/write performance up to 520/450MB/s and greater reliability than 2D NAND SSDs. The SU650 features SLC caching and advanced error correction technologies to ensure optimized data performance and integrity. For those who want to experience a clear PC upgrade, the SU650 is an excellent choice with a great cost-performance ratio.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	3D NAND in an easy PC upgrade

	&nbsp;

	With 3D NAND Flash, the SU650 features higher efficiency and increased reliability compared to 2D NAND SSDs with an improved cost-performance ratio.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Faster performance

	&nbsp;

	The intelligent SLC caching algorithm allows NAND Flash memory to operate in single-level cell mode and boosts performance, helping sustain peak SU650 read/write speeds up to 520/450MB per second for smoother and faster boot, file transfers, and downloads.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Advanced error correction code

	&nbsp;

	With the support for ECC (error correction code) technology, the SU650 can detect and fix errors to ensure data integrity and help to extend SSD lifespan Its MTBF (mean time between failures) is up to 2 million hours, or 25% more than 2D NAND SSDs.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Tougher , quieter , and more reliable

	&nbsp;

	There&#39;s no mechanical component inside SSDs, so they outperform traditional HDDs with higher resistance to shock, vibration (1500G/0.5ms) and extreme temperatures (0&deg;C-70&deg;C). They are also completely silent and consume very little power, all while better protecting your data.

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	Proprietary software - SSD Toolbox and Migration Utility

	&nbsp;

	Every SU650 purchase qualifies for free downloads of ADATA SSD Toolbox and Migration Utility. SSD Toolbox allows users to monitor and manage the SU650, with drive status, wear level, and lifespan information. The Migration Utility is especially helpful for users making the move from HDD to SSD, as it is designed for simple and quick backup and migration of the contents of entire drives, including the operating system.

		Click Energy Saving ESART Series II (ALTO) for specifications.


	Due to rising electricity costs, Energy Saving has become one of today&#39;s most important issues. It is a trend to operate ECO - Economical mode on big capacity on-line double conversion UPS. This seems to virtually turn UPS back to Stand by (0ff-line) era.
	
	Our new ES pure sine wave line-interactive UPS are based on Energy Saving technology. In addition to providing high quality Sine Wave power and low Harmonic Distortion to support both Linear and Non-linear loads the ES series has a built in wide range AVR (automatic voltage regulator) on Bypass circuit which stabilises power and makes the ES series operate even more effectively and safely than an On-line double conversion UPS operated under ECO mode.
	
	ES pure sine wave line-interactive UPS
	vs
	On-line double conversion UPS operated under ECO mode
	
	
		
			Wider input range: More than 10% wider input main power voltage range than an on-line UPS.
		
			High overall efficiency: Consumes much less power than an on-line double conversion UPS during bypass mode operation.
		
			Better stability: Concise designed compact unit gives better stability.
		
			Economically smaller: Smaller footprint. Less expense for users.

		Battery Backup
		Supplies power long enough for equipment to properly shut down when utility power fails. Helps prevent loss of data and minimizes the component stress caused by a hard shutdown.
	
		Surge Protection
		Diverts excess voltage away from sensitive electronic equipment during an AC power surge or power spike to prevent damage.
	
		Line Interactive Topology
		Exists when a line interactive UPS has an autotransformer that regulates low voltages (e.g., brownouts) and over voltages (e.g., spikes) without having to switch to battery.
	
		Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR)
		Provides clean, consistent AC power by automatically increasing (boosting) low voltage without using battery power when incoming utility power experiences minor fluctuations.
	
		Sine Wave Output
		Provides power protection to ENERGY STAR&reg; 6.0 systems with Active PFC power supplies.
	
		EMI/RFI Noise Filter
		Maintains clean power for connected equipment by filtering out electromagnetic and radio frequency interference to improve picture and sound quality.
	
		Durable Metal Housing
		Protects internal components and resists damage from impact or abrasions within challenging industrial environments. It also extends the life of the product.
	
		Multifunction LCD Panel
		Displays immediate, detailed information about the UPS battery and power conditions, alerting users to potential problems before they can affect critical equipment and cause downtime. Toggle status display includes information about UPS vitals: Input Voltage Level, Output Voltage Level, Automatic Voltage Regulator, Battery Capacity, Energy-Saving Bypass Mode, Runtime Estimate, Load Level, Output Frequency, On Battery, Overload, Fault Condition, Event Logging, and Silent Mode.
	
		Audible Alarms
		Identify model overloads, low battery, and when the model is running on battery power.
	
		Tamper-Proof Power Button
		Minimizes the chance the UPS can be accidentally turned off.
	
		PowerPanel&reg; Business Edition Software
		Provides IT professionals with tools for monitoring and managing the UPS and backup power. This software offers remote management functionality.&nbsp;
	
		ENERGY STAR
		This model is an ENERGY STAR&reg; certified Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system. ENERGY STAR is the trusted, government-backed symbol for energy-efficient products and practices that help save money and protect the environment.
	
		Three-Year Warranty
		CyberPower will repair or replace a defective UPS system (including batteries) within three years of the purchase date. See warranty for details. See warranty for details.
	
		Connected Equipment Guarantee

	3 is a Magic Number

	As all good things come in three, our new OTG Mobile C50 has three connectors &ndash; USB Type-A, Micro-B, and Type-C. Never lost between interfaces again, you can easily share data between new-generation USB Type-C devices, any good ol&rsquo; USB laptop or PC, and micro-B smartphones or tablets. You can also stop fretting about which pictures or songs to delete on your mobile devices and free up to 128GB valuable storage instantly. That&rsquo;s a lot of flexibility and freedom without cables or network constraints in one small drive - for truly universal access and versatility on the go. So 3 really is a magic number&hellip;

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	
		Ahead of the Game With Type-C
	
		Old school or ahead of the game? No matter what your type is - Type-C is spreading fast. The universal interface of the future is reversible &ndash; it always fits the first time. Stay connected and ahead of the game with our new C50.
	
		&nbsp;
	
		&nbsp;
	
		&nbsp;
	
		
	
		&nbsp;
	
		
			Clever Design for Protection and Longevity
		
			Ah, this is clever. The Type-C connector is protected by a sturdy, yet highly elastic rubber cap that is ready to be snapped open over 10,000 times. And as it is firmly attached to the drive, there&rsquo;s no need to worry about leaving it behind somewhere. On the other end, the micro-B is protectively covered by the USB connector when not in use. For easy plug and play on any Android device, just fold the outer one up and get connected.
		
			&nbsp;
		
			&nbsp;
		
			
		
			&nbsp;
		
			
				&hellip;and for Compactness and Easy Handling
			
				Its clever construction is not only made for perfect protection, but also for easy handling and transport. It&rsquo;s really compact and has a hole to attach it to key rings or bags. And thanks to its good and ergonomic grip, the C50 is easy to plug and remove. Rubber rules!
			
				&nbsp;
			
				&nbsp;
			
				
			
				&nbsp;
			
				
					SP File Explorer &ndash; Manages Your Files Smartly and For Free
				
					Especially designed for Type-C devices and Android&trade; smartphones or tablets, our SP File Explorer offers automatic file categorization and an incredibly convenient one-touch backup solution.&nbsp;
				
					&nbsp;

	* 4G LTE Modems Compatibility apply to TL-MR3420 Version 2.0 ONLY.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	What This Product Does

	Share the freedom of 3G/4G! The TL-MR3420 3G/4G Wireless N Router allows&nbsp;users to share a&nbsp;3G/4G mobile broadband connection with family and friends via wired or wireless connections. By connecting a 3G/4G USB modem to the routers, a Wi-Fi hotspot is instantly established, via which multiple devices can access the Internet and share data and applications wirelessly.

	&nbsp;

	Enjoy 3G/4G Wireless Sharing

	TL-MR3420 features blazing 4G speeds and backward compatible with 3G modems, allowing users to share a 3G/4G mobile broadband with family and friends via wired or wireless connection.

	Tests in the Field-High Compatibility

	Compatibility is the most important aspect to consider when you&#39;re selecting&nbsp;a 3G/4G router. To ensure&nbsp;the best&nbsp;compatibility between our routers and the modem you would use with&nbsp;the router, TP-LINK has made certain that our 3G/4G Routers are compatible with the ISPs in the regions in which they are sold. We have teams around the globe continually testing our Routers with newly emerged&nbsp;modems to ensure that end users can feel confident that their routers will operate flawlessly where they live and work.

	Comprehensive 3G/4G and WAN Connection Backup Strategy

	The TL-MR3420 stands out with its 3G/ 4G and WAN connection back-up, which keeps users online when one connection fails. TP-LINK&#39;s 3G/4G Router provides users with both 3G/4G Preferred and WAN Preferred back-up modes, while other brands provide one or the other. This brings users a high degree of flexibility when users are setting up&nbsp;the networks with considering connection costs and length of downtime.

	Wireless N Speed &amp; Range

	Complying with the IEEE 802.11n standard, the TL-MR3420 can establish a wireless network with transmission speeds of up to 300Mbps, while mitigating data loss over long distances and through obstacles in a small office or a large apartment, even in a steel-and-concrete building. Above all, users can easily pick up their wireless network&#39;s signal at longer distances from the router, where with legacy 11g products they would have to be much closer.

	WPA / WPA2 Encryptions -Advanced Security

	&nbsp;

	In order to safeguard user&lsquo;s Wi-Fi networks, WEP encryption is no longer strong enough. The TL-MR3420 provides WPA/WPA2 encryptions (Both Personal and Enterprise),created by the WI-FI Alliance, promoting interpretabilities and security for WLAN, to protect against almost any threat that the Internet or intruders may harbor.

	* All above information apply to TL-MR3420 version 2.0 ONLY.

Also, WPS button on the sleek and fashionable exterior ensures WPA2 encryptions, preventing the network from outside intrusions.

	Wireless N Speed &amp; Range

	Complying with the IEEE 802.11n standard, TL-WR841N can establish a wireless network and get up to 15X the speed and 5X the range of conventional 11g products. Also, with transmission rates up to 300Mbps.

	&nbsp;

	

	It shows more excellent abilities of mitigating data loss over long distances and through obstacles in a small office or a large apartment, even in a steel-and-concrete building. Above all, you could easily pick up the wireless network during long-distance connection where legacy 11g products may not! Which also means, the router has the speed to work smoothly with almost any bandwidth intensive application including VoIP, HD streaming, or online gaming, without the lag.

	&nbsp;

	

	WPA / WPA2 Encryptions - Advanced Security

	As for the security of WI-FI connection, WEP encryption has been no longer the strongest and safest guards for outside threats. TL-WR841N provides WPA/WPA2 encryptions (Both Personal and Enterprises) that are created by the WI-FI Alliance industry group, promoting interpretabilities and security for WLAN.

	WPS - One Button Security

	The TL-WR841N features Wi-Fi Protected Setup&trade; (WPS)&nbsp;that allows users to almost instantly setup their security simply by pressing the &quot;WPS&quot; button automatically establishing a WPA2 secure connection, which is more security compared with WEP encryptions. Not only is this faster than normal security setups but more convenient in that you don&rsquo;t need to remember a password!

	IP QoSï¼Controlled Bandwidth Allocation

	The speed of your wireless network is extremely temperamental, and can be due to indiscriminate users or applications hogging all the bandwidth. TP-LINK&#39;s TL-WR940N supports IP QoS (Quality of Service) function, which offers optimum utilization of bandwidth through the use of bandwidth congestion control. This means that users of small networks will enjoy bandwidth allocation specifically for them, preventing non-critical wireless usage from degrading network performance.

	&nbsp;

	&nbsp;

	

	Easy Setup

	The device comes with a CD with an Easy Setup Assistant that leads you through the setup process step-by-step, and even helps with wireless network settings and security configurations, which is convenient to the users, especially for novice users.
