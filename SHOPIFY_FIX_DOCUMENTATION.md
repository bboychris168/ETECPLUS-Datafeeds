# Shopify Duplicate Title Fix

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: When exporting CSV files for Shopify import, products with identical titles would generate identical handles, causing Shopify to reject the import with the error:
```
Validation failed: The variant 'Default Title' already exists
```

## Root Cause

When multiple products have the same title (e.g., "Gaming Mouse RGB"), Shopify generates identical handles (`gaming-mouse-rgb`). Since handles must be unique in Shopify, this causes import failures.

## Solution Implemented

Added intelligent duplicate title handling that:

1. **Detects Duplicate Titles**: Identifies when multiple products have the same title
2. **Ranks by Cost**: Sorts duplicates by cost (lowest to highest)
3. **Adds Numbered Suffixes**: Appends numbered suffixes to create unique titles and handles

## Example Transformation

**Before (Causes Shopify Error):**
```
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB    → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB    → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb  ❌ DUPLICATE
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB    → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb  ❌ DUPLICATE
```

**After (Shopify Compatible):**
```
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB        → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb      ($19.99 - Cheapest)
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB (2)    → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb-2    ($25.99)
Title: Gaming Mouse RGB (3)    → Handle: gaming-mouse-rgb-3    ($35.50 - Most expensive)
```

## How It Works

1. **Cost-Based Ranking**: The system automatically keeps the lowest-cost item with the original title
2. **Sequential Numbering**: Higher-cost duplicates get numbered suffixes (2), (3), etc.
3. **Unique Handles**: Each numbered title generates a unique handle for Shopify
4. **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention required - works automatically during CSV export

## User Benefits

- ✅ **No More Import Errors**: Eliminates "Default Title already exists" errors
- ✅ **Price Priority**: Cheapest item keeps the original, recognizable title
- ✅ **Clear Differentiation**: Easy to identify which is the lowest-cost option
- ✅ **Automatic Processing**: Works seamlessly in the background
- ✅ **Maintains Product Identity**: Original product names remain intact for the best-priced items

## Technical Implementation

The fix is implemented in the `create_unique_handles_and_titles()` function within `streamlit_app.py` at line ~1465. The function:

1. Groups products by title to identify duplicates
2. Sorts each group by cost (ascending)
3. Preserves the original title for the lowest-cost item
4. Adds numbered suffixes to higher-cost duplicates
5. Generates unique handles from the modified titles

## Verification

Run the test script to see the fix in action:
```bash
python test_duplicate_titles.py
```

This will demonstrate how duplicate titles are automatically resolved with cost-based ranking.

## Migration Notes

- **Existing Data**: No impact on existing Shopify products
- **Backwards Compatible**: CSV exports without duplicates work exactly as before
- **Cost Transparency**: Users can easily identify the most cost-effective options
- **Handle Consistency**: Handles follow Shopify's standard format requirements
